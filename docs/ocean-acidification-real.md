# A CLAIM ANALYSIS

The claim that I found to be most compelling was from the website titled “Global Climate Change Facts: The Truth, The Consensus, and the Skeptics”, which is authored by Dr. John T. Everett (Everett, 2020). Everett has a doctorate and master’s degree focused on Natural Resources Management, Resource Management, and Quantitative Methods (Everett, 2011). Additionally, Everett has contributed to 5 IPCC analyses from 1988-2000, and has been on the board coordinating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Change Research Program (Everett, 2011). All of these qualifications seem appropriate and relevant for the topics discussed on Everett’s website. Despite these qualifications, there have been several instances of his claims being refuted on the basis of misuse of sources, questionable extrapolations, or simple confusion of terms. 

The claim of interest is titled “Is Ocean Acidification Real? Is it Bad?”, and attempts to convince the reader that increased ocean CO2 levels leading to acidification is not problematic. Everett not only has this claim listed on his website intended for a general reader, but presented it to the US Senate in April, 2010 (Everett, 2010). Everett’s claim is based on 4 factors: marine life should flourish with increased CO2 and acidification, historic ocean warming and acidification has been much greater and the memory of this is built into the genetics of marine species, observational data shows no oceanic changes due to acidification, and changes in the environment are natural and expected (Everett, 2020). This claim was interesting because it promised success for marine life by supporting the organisms at the base of the food chain in lieu of the opposite projected by the IPCC (IPCC, 2020). 

Several flaws in Everett’s line of reasoning immediately become clear. The most glaring is that most of the claims made do not have any scientific sources attached to them, and are simply cited as ‘laboratory work’ or ‘observational data’. The lack of literary support makes it challenging to assess the validity of his claims, and implies that the reader is supposed to take his word for it. Secondly, the only source that Everett includes is misused. He states that ‘crustaceans respond[ing] favourably in research by Ries et al.’, however, the reference he cites is misused and does not support this claim (Ries, et al., 2009). Instead, the reference places emphasis on the varying responses that benthic marine organisms had to increased ocean acidity, and concludes that it will be difficult to predict how these changes will impact the survival of these organisms (Ries, et al., 2009). Everett also misuses the work of Iglesias-Rodriguez et al. (2008) when he concludes that ‘shell forming algae do much better in a higher CO2 environment’. The authors responded clarifying that while the calcifying plankton showed increased calcification, their growth rates were impaired under high CO2 conditions (Iglesias-Rodriguez & Ries, 2010). 

At first glance, Everett’s claims are interesting at best. With even a quick look at the sources his conclusions are based on, it is clear to see that the majority of his arguments are scientific research that has been shoehorned into his climate-skeptic perspective. Everett’s somewhat relevant academic background is misleading to a general reader as falsely promises credibility. It is therefore the responsibility of the reader to verify the sources of his claims rather than trust his titles and accomplishments.
